I'm a patent attorney at [Lewis Roca Rothgerber Christie LLP](https://www.lrrc.com/shaun-lee) and help my clients build their intellectual property portfolios. Lately, that has involved inventions in machine learning, especially deep neural networks for image processing. I'm always excited to learn about technology and to talk about patents.

Evenings frequently spent goofing around with Haskell, Python, TensorFlow, and other languages or software tools of the week. This blog generally serves as my documentation of this goofing around.

On weekends, I often hike in the Angeles National Forest.
