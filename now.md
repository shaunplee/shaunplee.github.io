I'm a patent attorney at [Lewis Roca](https://www.lrrc.com/shaun-lee), where I spend my days helping clients build their intellectual property portfolios. Lately, that has often involved inventions in machine learning (especially deep neural networks for image processing), but sometimes it's digital signal processing or wireless communications or natural language processing.

Evenings frequently spent goofing around with Haskell/PureScript, fixing my Emacs configuration, Python, TensorFlow, and other languages or software tools of the week. This blog generally serves as my documentation of this goofing around.

On weekends, I like hiking in the Angeles National Forest. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has scared me off the single-track trails, so that extra free time is now often spent running, making pancakes, and baking sourdough and small batches of cookies.
